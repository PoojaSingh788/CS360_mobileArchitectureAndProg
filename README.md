#	Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The Inventory Control Application was developed to address the critical need for efficient and effective inventory management in businesses and personal settings. Its primary goal was to allow users to authenticate securely, manage inventory items (add, update, delete), receive low inventory notifications, and visualize inventory through a grid view. The app caters to users needing a robust, reliable, and user-friendly system to track and manage their inventory accurately and effortlessly.
#	What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The application includes four main screens: Login, Grid View Display, Settings and Notifications, and Add Items. These screens support essential functions such as secure login, inventory visualization, configuration of notifications, and adding new items. The design emphasizes user friendliness with a soothing color palette and intuitive navigation, reducing user strain and enhancing usability.
#	How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
Initially, the development process was ambitious, leading to complexity and a non-functional app. Learning from this, I adopted an incremental approach—starting with a stable, minimal viable product and gradually adding features. This method ensured the core functionality was robust before expanding, reducing risks of major bugs and improving manageability. In future projects, this approach can be applied to ensure a stable foundation is established before scaling or adding complexity.
#	How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Testing was conducted using various emulated devices within the Android SDK, covering a range of screen sizes and operating systems. This was crucial to ensure the app worked seamlessly across different devices and conditions. The process is important as it reveals device-specific issues, inconsistencies in UI, and potential crashes that might not be evident during development. It highlighted the importance of responsive design and the need for thorough, iterative testing.
#	Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
A notable challenge was integrating the notification system with the user settings. Initially, the settings did not trigger notifications as expected due to issues with state management. I innovated by diving deeper into Android’s notification framework and improving state management, which led to a more reliable and functional notification system that integrated smoothly with the rest of the app.
#	In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I was particularly successful in implementing the login authentication feature. Using my knowledge in SQL and various database management systems, I was able to create a secure and efficient authentication system. This component not only showcased my skills in database integration but also highlighted my ability to ensure data security and user privacy in mobile applications.
